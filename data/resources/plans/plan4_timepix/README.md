Special plans used with timepix detector.

RN.1.2.246.352.71.5.37402163639.167545.20221021131727.dcm : ?
RN.1.2.246.352.71.5.37402163639.170033.20221101132840.dcm : plan with last layer 149 MeV and we simply used the last layer for the irradiations instead of SOBP.


Irradiations for microdosemeters were performed in Racehorse so we could lowered the beam current.
