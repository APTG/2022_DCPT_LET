# Phantom design:
- 30 x 30 cm² slabs of Gammex solid water, 20 cm thick
- one 30 x 30 x 0.5 cm³ slab of PMMA which hold detectors of interest.
This slab will always be positioned so its center plane (0.25 cm depth in the PMMA slab) will mark the measurement position.
- Target scoring volume should be small enough in z direction, and larger, but not too large laterally. We suggest:
  - 2 mm thick along z, centered on the reference depth as described below for the different plans.
  - Laterally we suggest 5 cm in x and y, centered on the z-axis.
