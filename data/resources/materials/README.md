# Description of Materials

## Gammex Solid Water HE
https://www.sunnuclear.com/products/solid-water-he

Density: 1.032 +/- 0.005 g/cm3
Electron density: 1.000 rho_e_SW,w.

Elemental composition for Solid Water HE is unknown.
For earlier SW versions, density and the electron density was slightly lower (1.018 g/cm3 and 0.989 rho_e_SW,w) than for the HE version.
SW elemental composition by weight for the non-HE version is reported in

**Notes:**
We here suggest to simply adjust Solid Water density to match the exact positions of the distal edge,
depend on the unknown I-value and the Bragg-additivity rule is only an approximation.
