1) Base plans where made in Raystation.
2) Base plans where then imported and exported in Eclipse, without any recalculation. 
3) Those Eclipse plans where then additionally edited with [DicomFix](https://github.com/nbassler/dicomfix), for irradiation.

In the github repo, the final RTPLAN file is available, and RTDOSE (RD\*.dcm) and RTSTRUCT (RS\*.dcm) are taken from the Raystation Baseplan.
