Results are shown for each phase-space file, and I tried to adjust the naming according to SHIELD-hit results.

*narrow_dose_p02 - dose  (F6 tally)  along the Z-axis in MeV/g/SP
*target_p02 - dose  (F6 tally) in target volume in MeV/g/SP
*narrow dose_p01 - flux of primary particles along z-axis
*narrow_LET_p3 - DLET Protons [MEV/cm]
*narrow_LET_p6 - TLET Protons [MEV/cm]
