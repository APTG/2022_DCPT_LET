Results are shown for each phase-space file, and I tried to adjust the naming according to SHIELD-hit results.

Plan_1_1 - corresponds to plan 1 - simulated form phase-space plan_1_1

MCNP for F4 tally uses "track length estimate of particle flux", and all the results are normalized per SP (Spurce Particle). "The values provided in the energy bins are interpreted as stopping power values with units of
MeV/cm". 


*narrow_dose_p02 - dose  (F6 tally)  along the Z-axis in MeV/g/SP

*target_p02 - dose  (F6 tally) in target volume in MeV/g/SP

*narrow dose_p01 - flux of primary particles along z-axis

*narrow_LET_p3 - DLET Protons [MEV/cm]

*narrow_LET_p6 - TLET Protons [MEV/cm]
